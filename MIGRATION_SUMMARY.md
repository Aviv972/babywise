# Babywise Assistant Migration Summary

## Changes Made for Vercel Deployment

1. **Created Vercel Entry Point**
   - Created `api/index.py` to serve as the entry point for Vercel serverless functions
   - This file imports the FastAPI app from `server.py` and exposes it for Vercel

2. **Added Vercel Configuration**
   - Created `vercel.json` with configuration for Python 3.9 runtime
   - Set up routes to direct all traffic to the API entry point
   - Configured environment variables for Python

3. **Updated Server Implementation**
   - Modified `server.py` to use path-based file access for better compatibility
   - Added support for environment variable PORT to allow Vercel to set the port
   - Improved .env file detection for different environments

4. **Created Vercel-specific Requirements**
   - Added `api/requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies for Vercel

5. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `README.md` with Vercel deployment information
   - Created `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` with detailed migration steps
   - Created `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md` with considerations for Vercel deployment

6. **Added Git Support**
   - Updated `.gitignore` to include Vercel-specific files
   - Created `init_git.sh` script to initialize the Git repository

## Files Created or Modified

- **New Files:**
  - `api/index.py` - Vercel entry point
  - `api/requirements.txt` - Vercel dependencies
  - `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
  - `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed migration steps
  - `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md` - Vercel deployment considerations
  - `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file
  - `init_git.sh` - Git initialization script

- **Modified Files:**
  - `server.py` - Updated for Vercel compatibility
  - `README.md` - Updated with Vercel information
  - `.gitignore` - Added Vercel-specific entries

## Next Steps

1. **Test Locally**
   - Run the application locally to ensure it works as expected
   - Test all API endpoints and frontend functionality

2. **Initialize Git Repository**
   - Run the `init_git.sh` script to initialize the Git repository
   - Connect to the remote repository on GitHub

3. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Add the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   - Deploy the application

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - Test the deployed application
   - Check all functionality works as expected

5. **Consider Database Migration**
   - For production use, consider migrating from SQLite to a cloud database
   - Options include Supabase, PlanetScale, MongoDB Atlas, or Vercel Postgres

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Database Persistence**
   - SQLite database is stored in ephemeral storage on Vercel
   - Data may not persist between function invocations

2. **Cold Starts**
   - First request after inactivity may be slow
   - Consider implementing a "keep-alive" mechanism

3. **Execution Time Limits**
   - Vercel has a 10-second execution time limit for the Hobby plan
   - Ensure all API endpoints complete within this time

4. **Package Size**
   - Vercel has a limit on the size of the deployment package
   - May need to optimize dependencies if the package is too large
